# PACKAGE TRAVEL

It is thought like a microservice. I wanted to have a clean structure of the code, so I cut out all the main components of my application in different folders. So each one of these would have a data layer to manage all the ins and outs of the data to the component, a presentational layer, that is composed of all the lookand fill part. So if the graphical design is not good enough, it would be easy to change that, this presentational layer is the index.tsx file in each of the components. There would be a config layer to choose the presentational information for each one of the components, and there would be two more layers, one is the use cases layer and the other is model layer, which is composed for the main uses cases of the component, and all the information which comes from the business model respectively.
